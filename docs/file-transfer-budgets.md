# Managed file transfer budgets

This release adds the budget boundary to the existing attachments service. It does not implement project-local resolution, encrypted temporary transfers, idle-file expiry, or the separate public-media migration. Deploy it with a client that supplies the upload size, actor and group scope. Older unscoped upload requests fail closed: an upload that declares no size gets `426 client_outdated`, whose message asks the person to update Gugu.

## Guarantees and limits

| Rule | Enforcement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global monthly download budget | Reserve the object's verified length before signing; one transaction checks global, account and source-group headroom. UTC months. Pending capabilities remain held across month boundaries. | `fileTransferBudget.test.ts`, `fileTransferConcurrency.test.ts` |
| Account/group budgets | The authenticated human account pays for its Agents. Topics use the source group. Failed reservations leave no partial debit. | Same integration suites, `topicSourceResources.test.ts` |
| Global/account/group storage | Count physical inventory, referenced objects and pending upload capacity before issuing a permit. Forwarding and publication also check receiving scope. | Same integration suites |
| Short-lived downloads | The existing CDN Type A / Storage signer issues a 60-second capability after reservation. CDN authentication lifetime must be declared correctly; a request-rate limit is optional. | `fileTransferCore.test.ts`, `attachmentStorageConfig.test.ts` |
| Bound uploads and one registration | Unpredictable uploader-scoped keys, provider-enforced maximum and lifetime, immutable source, streamed SHA-256, one receipt and original scope. Retain staging and its capacity until trusted terminal cleanup. | `attachmentsOss.test.ts`, `attachmentSupabaseStorage7628.test.ts`, budget integration |
| Trusted reconciliation | Service-only import; provider request ID deduplicates events. Match the signed download ID to the exact stored object; changed duplicate identities abort the entire batch. Client ACKs cannot refund a reservation. | `fileTransferLogs.test.ts`, `fileTransferLogCli.test.ts`, budget integration |

A signed URL is a replayable bearer capability. Sixty seconds limits **new request admission**, not the duration of an accepted response. A request may continue after expiry, and parallel replays can spend more bytes than the single pre-reservation. A deployment may operate without per-request throttling; this replay amplification risk is explicitly accepted. Optional rate limiting is not a total-byte cap, and the reserved length is not an exact cloud spending ceiling. Actual replay bytes can exceed the reservation; trusted observations debit them in full and stop later signing. Cached responses must pass the same URL authentication. Keep a separate provider bandwidth/monthly cap and billing alert as operational protection.

No permanent file is evicted to satisfy a quota. This release contains no LRU. A later temporary-transfer provider may evict only its own temporary objects.

## Deployment settings

Download admission calculates usage directly from the original reservation and observation ledgers. The existing global limits row serializes only signature-rate checks, quota checks and the reservation insert. A shared row is necessary for the installation-wide hard download budget: locking different accounts or groups independently would let them overbook the same global headroom. Observations and settlement enter the same fence before changing usage. There is no copied usage total or reconciliation path.

Downloads do not acquire the installation-wide storage/inventory/GC advisory lock. Reference resolution runs before quota admission; garbage collection uses the existing per-blob shared-lock fence, expiry coordinates on the individual storage reference, and read-once transfers lock their own generation. Only retries of the same request ID share a download advisory lock. Usage and its UTC-month treatment, immutable request IDs, and signature-rate limits retain their existing ledger semantics.

`chat.file_transfer_limits` is service-only. Insert one `scope='global', scope_id='*'` JSON object. There are deliberately no deployment quota values in the migration. Account/group rows override the corresponding keys in the global object; unspecified keys inherit. Use parameterized SQL through a protected operator connection.

| JSON key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `storage_global_bytes`, `storage_account_bytes`, `storage_group_bytes` | Physical storage and held upload allowance, in bytes |
| `download_global_bytes`, `download_account_bytes`, `download_group_bytes` | Monthly egress reservations/observations, in bytes |
| `file_max_bytes` | Public upload permit ceiling |
| `upload_permit_seconds` | Must equal the selected provider's enforceable policy lifetime |
| `download_link_bits_per_second` (optional) | Omit for no declared request-rate limit. If present, use 819200–838860800 bit/s; direct OSS signatures bind it. CDN/Storage edge throttles are independently provisioned and are not installed or proved by this value. |
| `sign_window_seconds`, `sign_account_count`, `sign_group_count` | New download-signature rate window and count limits |
| `inventory_ready` | Initially absent/false; enable only after a complete trusted physical inventory and scope audit |
| `paused` | Stop new upload/download reservations immediately; already issued bearer capabilities remain usable within their provider rules |

Numeric settings are nonnegative safe integers. A zero quota disables that allowance. Missing required settings refuse issuance. Reducing a limit below current usage does not delete files; it prevents new reservations. Update `updated_at` with the configuration change and retain the operator change record. Never write a service credential into SQL examples, request URLs or logs.

OSS/CDN uses the existing `OSS_*`, `CDN_DOMAIN` and `CDN_AUTH_KEY_PRIMARY` configuration. Set `CDN_AUTH_TTL_SECONDS` to the edge's actual Type A authentication lifetime. CDN signing does not require a rate declaration or compare it to a permit; `CDN_REQUEST_LIMIT_BITS_PER_SECOND` is no longer consumed. The signer reuses the existing crypto and chooses a timestamp whose **timestamp + edge TTL** expires in 60 seconds. An environment value declares configuration; it does not install an edge policy or prove enforcement. Verify both normal and cached responses against the real provider before enabling production signing. OSS upload admission requires a bucket that has **never enabled versioning**: forbid-overwrite alone does not bound historical versions.

The community Supabase provider has different capabilities: signed uploads have a fixed 7200-second lifetime and no per-object size policy. Admission reads the actual finite bucket ceiling, reserves that ceiling rather than the declared small size, and requires it to fit the configured file allowance. The community adapter still buffers reads; this change does not make it fully streaming. Configure `upload_permit_seconds=7200` and `file_max_bytes` to cover that bucket ceiling. Downloads use the same 60-second Storage capability without requiring `SUPABASE_STORAGE_REQUEST_LIMIT_BITS_PER_SECOND`. `GUGU_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` may identify its public gateway. Supabase signing alone supplies no request throttle. A gateway or cache must still authenticate newly admitted requests after expiry; cache-hit and cache-miss expiry must be validated independently. Adding an actual provider rate policy later does not introduce another resolver or signer.

## Inventory and activation

1. Stop managed writes and complete an authoritative inventory of every billed provider/prefix, including abandoned staging and objects without a database reference. Do not treat metadata-only backfill as physical inventory.
2. Export canonical JSONL records `{ "bucket_id": "oss", "object_name": "logical/key", "size_bytes": 123 }` from the trusted inventory. Strip the configured physical prefix. Unknown length is an error; a real zero-byte object is distinct. For the community native provider, new managed blobs retain the logical database bucket `oss` while their physical bytes live in the configured attachments bucket; inventory must use that same logical mapping. Historical workspace objects retain `workspace`.
3. Load credentials in the process environment and stream the protected export to `node scripts/import-file-transfer-logs.mjs inventory`. Set `GUGU_FILE_TRANSFER_IMPORT_URL` to the HTTPS `/attachments/storage-inventory` route and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in the environment. Loopback HTTP is allowed for a disposable fixture.
4. Reconcile object counts/bytes and source-group/account attribution, including old workspace versions and private task attachments. Orphans still consume the global allowance. Unknown account ownership must be resolved before claiming complete account attribution.
5. Set all deployment limits and only then enable `inventory_ready`. The import route never sets it. Reconcile in-flight staging against held reservations before reopening writes so that the same staging object is not counted twice.

Inventory upserts are repeatable and do not resurrect objects already marked deleting/gone. They do not infer physical absence from a partial listing or release capacity. Reference backfill preserves existing blob IDs, versions and exact ACLs. Old workspace Storage access is restricted to the same managed service: raw authenticated reads/writes/deletes cannot bypass budgets. Public legacy media remains a separate deployment boundary until its private-object cutover; an already public URL cannot be secured by quota signing alone.

## Provider traffic reconciliation

Use authenticated, protected exports from the configured provider account; never ingest logs supplied by a reader. The import route accepts only the service credential. Keep exports private: raw request URIs may contain bearer signatures. The parser transmits only request ID, managed download UUID, logical object, completion timestamp and response-body bytes, and prints aggregate counts only.

| Source | Required official export fields |
| --- | --- |
| CDN realtime SLS JSON | `method`, `domain`, `uri`, `uri_param`, `uuid`, `body_bytes_sent`, `unixtime` |
| OSS SLS JSON | `http_method`, `host`, `request_uri`, `request_id`, `response_body_length`, `__time__`, `sync_request` |

For OSS, export `url_decode(request_uri) AS request_uri` because SLS stores that field URL-encoded. Preserve the URI's own object encoding; do not repeatedly decode paths. CDN authentication's signed `rand` is the managed download UUID without hyphens. The OSS adapter recognizes `gugu-download-id` for a future authenticated direct-OSS provider; this release's managed OSS reads use CDN. Do not enable an adapter whose attribution identifier is absent or not covered by the provider's signed authorization.

Set `GUGU_FILE_LOG_DOMAIN` to the exact source domain and `GUGU_FILE_LOG_OBJECT_PREFIX` to its physical prefix, then run `node scripts/import-file-transfer-logs.mjs cdn` or `oss` with JSONL on stdin. The endpoint is `/attachments/usage-import`. Batches contain at most 512 events. Replaying overlapping exports is safe. A changed event ID payload or wrong object fails the batch atomically. A failed run may have committed earlier batches; restart from the same trusted export.

HEAD requests are excluded. OSS CDN-origin requests (`sync_request='cdn'`) are excluded from the user's download ledger to avoid charging the same transfer twice; reconcile origin charges separately. Response-body bytes do not equal every provider billing item: headers, CDN billing adjustments, origin traffic, requests and storage belong in the provider invoice comparison. Do not describe this ledger as a hard currency cap.

If logs are late or incomplete, keep outstanding reservations and pause issuance before unsafe headroom accumulates. Do not refund on expiry, one successful log record, a client completion message, or a partial range. After the provider's complete delivery window is independently verified, an operator may call service-only `chat.file_transfer_settle(download_id)` for an expired capability with observations. That call is an operational assertion of finality, not a log-completeness detector. Later observations are still accepted and charged in their observed UTC month. Downloads with no final evidence remain conservatively held.

## Staging and cleanup

Uploads reserve twice the enforceable maximum while immutable staging and the final object coexist. Successful registration charges the actual final bytes and retains the remaining staging hold. Reusing an issued upload UUID cannot move actor/group/maximum or mint a fresh lifetime. Committing is idempotent and cannot create a second registration.

The existing blob GC remains the single final-object deletion path. It confirms physical deletion before releasing inventory capacity. The idle-expiry extension records that change atomically inside `file_blob_gc_finish`. Do not release an in-progress deletion's capacity.

An expired upload policy plus HEAD 404 is insufficient to prove an accepted upload cannot finish late. Do not automatically close staging on that evidence. Use trusted provider terminal-operation evidence, confirm physical absence, then call service-only `chat.file_managed_upload_closed(staging_key, evidence_reference)`. The reference is a short nonsecret audit identifier, not a URL or signature. The same operation releases abandoned never-registered reservations. If terminal finality cannot be established, retain the allowance and investigate; do not manufacture a refund. OSS lifecycle cleanup can remove old staging physically, but its asynchronous execution is not itself a receipt for a specific upload.

## Operational rollout and validation

Ship the client-only request preparation first: every upload sends size, actor, explicit chat/null and a request UUID through the same existing helper. The previous HTTP entry accepts these additive fields without a schema or RPC upgrade. Verify both release channels before enabling this enforcing service. Publishing a new client does not prove every installed client upgraded: inactive old clients remain unobservable and will fail after the explicit protocol cutover. The affected path includes managed chat/file, placement/replacement, delegated sends, private task handoff and mobile Agent uploads; unrelated direct media uploads are separate.

Keep the enforcing release staged until compatible clients, trusted inventory, quota configuration, readable bucket versioning and verified 60-second authentication are ready. Per-link throttling is optional, not an activation gate. Record the cutover time, supported minimum versions and observed old-protocol activity. A legacy empty-body request counter must be measured at the existing service boundary before claiming an active cohort has migrated; HTTP 400 totals alone do not identify a protocol or count devices. No client heartbeat or second transport path is needed. There is no bounded failure window for clients that never update.

Do not mutate the foundation or an installed migration ledger. Missing configuration or provider capability must fail visibly. Pause first if rolling back; do not restore an unbudgeted signer while live issued capabilities or held storage remain unaccounted for.

Prove real concurrent last-byte admission for all three download scopes and upload storage; identical retries charge once. Prove full storage refuses before a provider permit, unauthorized/repeated commits cannot publish bytes, one account's exhaustion leaves another account usable with shared headroom, and wrong/duplicate provider events cannot refund or partially apply. Existing protection changes are listed in [the test migration audit](file-transfer-test-migration.md).

Isolated PostgreSQL/HTTP and signing fixtures do not prove live OSS or CDN enforcement. A real dedicated test bucket/domain must prove size, overwrite rejection, expiry, cached authentication, parallel replay behavior, any optional request throttle, Range, genuine log ingestion and invoice comparison. Keep those cells pending until that environment exists. A MinIO protocol result is not an OSS result.

## Optional throttling policy change

The selected rollout keeps 60-second authentication, pre-reserved verified bytes, ACLs, signing-count limits and trusted reconciliation. It removes mandatory per-request throttling uniformly for every deployment, rather than adding an environment exception. This accepts concurrent replay amplification: the reservation is not a byte-hard or currency-hard cap. Provider budget alarms and usage caps remain operational protection. Configure a path-scoped or separate-domain CDN limit later without changing the single download entry point. Declare the optional rate only when the corresponding provider capability is actually provisioned; a number cannot create it.

No database migration is needed: the SQL quota core never required the rate key. Existing installations may keep a valid optional value; new installations may omit it. The direct OSS adapter still signs a provided rate in the same SDK request, and still refuses malformed optional rates or attempts to extend the original reservation.
